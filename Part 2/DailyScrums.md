# March 19th Scrum Meeting
# What did you do in the last 24 hours to help the team reach the Sprint Goal?
•	Kylie: I got Firebase up and running for both iOS and Android, configured authentication, and documented everything so everyone can follow along. Also, I started working on writing 20-unit tests to ensure the system's functionality is robust.
•	Jeffrey: Finished the Login screen UI in Flutter, started linking it with Firebase authentication, and worked on the Burndown Chart.
•	Moises: Helped Jeffrey connect the login form to Firebase, ensuring input validation for email and password.
•	Will: Began drafting our Sprint Review document and gathering feedback from the team.
•	Deo: Started writing automated and behavior-driven tests for authentication, making sure we cover key scenarios.
# What will you do in the next 24 hours to keep things moving?
•	Kylie: Finish setting up Firestore so user data is stored properly.
•	Jeffrey: Work on handling login errors smoothly and setting up user redirection after successful login.
•	Moises: Continue refining login functionality and writing unit tests to ensure stability.
•	Will: Finalize the Sprint Review document and prepare it for our presentation.
•	Deo: Complete the automated tests and verify they cover critical authentication cases.
# Any roadblocks or issues slowing you down?
•	Kylie: Firebase setup took longer than expected, but it’s all sorted now.
•	Jeffrey: Some UI components didn’t behave as expected, but I found a workaround that should work after testing.
