## Product Vision

### Far Vision
Adventra aims to be the go-to social platform for adventure seekers looking for like-minded partners. We envision a robust mobile app that uses AI-driven matching to pair users based on adventure type, skill level, and preferences.

### Near Vision
By the end of this semester, we aim to develop a Minimum Viable Product that allows users to:
- Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication
- Create and edit a profile with adventure preferences
- Swipe to match with adventure partners
- Chat with matched users through in-app messaging

### Stakeholders
- Adventure seekers looking for a partner (primary users)
- Potential sponsors, investors, and advertisers
- Development team, product owner, and scrum master
