April 16th – Daily Scrum
What did you work on recently?
• Kylie: I wrapped up our Firestore security rules and started drafting the research paper. I focused on the section explaining our system architecture.
• Jeffrey: I cleaned up the logout UI and started going through the onboarding screens to make sure the flow feels smooth.
• Moises: I helped debug the logout issues and took a look at the swipe logic—we had a few weird edge cases that I started addressing.
• Will: I updated our task board and started some basic wireframes for the settings screen layout.
• Deo: I got Firebase Hosting up and running! I tested the build and deployment process and also tweaked a couple of our automated tests to be more readable.

What’s next on your plate?
• Kylie: I’ll continue writing the research paper and double-check how we’re handling data access in Firestore.
• Jeffrey: I’m going to start building the onboarding screens in Flutter and make sure they match our design.
• Moises: I’ll work with Jeffrey on the onboarding logic and clean up any leftover swipe bugs.
• Will: I’m starting the actual settings screen—mostly working on the layout and toggles.
• Deo: I’ll refine the hosting setup, check how the site performs across different browsers, and test more edge cases.

Any blockers or issues?
• Kylie: Just figuring out the best way to format the research paper—it’s a bit annoying.
• Jeffrey: The onboarding animations aren’t quite right yet. Still tuning them.
• Moises: Swipe logic is acting up when the user hasn’t filled out any preferences.
• Will: No blockers yet.
• Deo: Hosting build times are kind of slow—looking into optimizing that.

April 23rd – Daily Scrum
What did you work on recently?
• Kylie: Finished the research paper draft and reviewed our Firestore rules. Everything seems secure and tight.
• Jeffrey: Built the onboarding UI and added some smooth animations to help the flow feel more engaging.
• Moises: Tested the onboarding logic and made sure profiles are set up correctly when users finish onboarding.
• Will: Got most of the settings screen working and added a toggle for switching themes.
• Deo: Integrated GitHub Actions so we can automatically deploy to Firebase Hosting when we push changes. Huge time saver.

What’s next?
• Kylie: I’ll document how we’ve structured Firestore and jump in with Moises to test profile logic.
• Jeffrey: I’m going to start designing and prototyping the matching screen.
• Moises: I’ll focus on handling user preferences and updating the matching logic accordingly.
• Will: I’ll hook the toggles into actual app settings and continue refining the UI.
• Deo: I’m testing the site across multiple browsers and screen sizes to make sure everything looks consistent.

Any issues?
• Kylie: Just juggling code and paper writing—it’s manageable though.
• Jeffrey: Still finessing animation timing—it gets a bit laggy on slow connections.
• Moises: A few cases where missing preferences are breaking things.
• Will: The theme toggle doesn’t persist across sessions yet.
• Deo: A couple of images didn’t render on the web build—working on it.

April 30th – Daily Scrum
What did you work on recently?
• Kylie: Finalized and submitted the research paper, and finished documenting Firestore permissions.
• Jeffrey: Completed the matching screen UI and added swipe feedback animations.
• Moises: Updated the preference logic and ran tests to check if the right matches were being shown.
• Will: Wrapped up the settings screen and got the toggle settings working and syncing with Firestore.
• Deo: Cleaned up the hosting settings, fixed layout issues, and helped test the swipe feature across browsers.

What are you focusing on next?
• Kylie: I’m helping test the full onboarding and matching experience and getting ready to finalize our documentation.
• Jeffrey: I’ll review the UI across all the screens and fix any last bugs.
• Moises: Finishing up tests on the match system and helping polish the overall experience.
• Will: Prepping our UI walkthrough for the sprint review and cleaning up any layout inconsistencies.
• Deo: Running full end-to-end tests and setting up the demo on Firebase Hosting for our team to review.

Any blockers?
• Kylie: Nothing big—just wrapping up and reviewing.
• Jeffrey: A few hiccups with animations not behaving on slower connections.
• Moises: Match results are sometimes off—we might need to tweak the logic.
• Will: Exporting some UI mockups from Flutter is still awkward.
• Deo: The layout looks a little off on wider screens, but I’m already fixing it.
