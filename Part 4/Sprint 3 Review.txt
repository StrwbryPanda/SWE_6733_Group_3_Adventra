Sprint Review Summary:

Goal of Sprint 2:
The goal of our first sprint was to try and ramp up development of the application. We wanted to be able to comfortably interact between the front end and back end.
We chose three issues to complete (25 story points):  
  - Add feature to allow users to create profile
  - Add feature to allow users to log out
  - Add feature to allow users to swipe for a match

What was completed:
We were able to

Challenges:
Much like the previous sprint, our team is still experiencing a tremendous amount of difficulty with the new tech stack. We are extremely unexperienced an unequipped for project of this technical magnitude, which is making hindering progress significantly. None of our team members have experience with flutter, or using firebase as an authentication service, so we are attempting to learn everything as we go. 

What Went Well?:
Despite the difficulties, the team is working around the clock to learn the new tech stack and implement features as needed. The managerial, agile aspects of this project's management has been successful for this team, and we are getting more comfortable holding sprint meetings and discussing progress/obstacles.

Next Sprint:
As we look ahead at Sprint 3, we'd like to start having a visible project take shape. There are more advanced features that we would love to incorporate if time and skills allow. Editing a profile and messaging between users would be great to tackle next sprint. We are seeking to gain experience using firebase as a secure messaging service between users.
