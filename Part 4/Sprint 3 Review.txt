Sprint Review Summary:

Goal of Sprint 3:
The main goal of our third spring was to have an overall functioning product that worked as designed. We were not necessarily concerned with aesthetics as much for this one. 
For this sprint we chose three issues (25 story points) to complete :  
  - Design a matching algorithm
  - Allow users to securely message each other
  - Allow users to edit their profile

What was completed:
While we didn't necessarily complete each individual issue, the project itself is beginning to take shape as a functioning product, at least for testing purposes.

Challenges:
We continue to face the same issues we have in previous sprints, which is the team's lack of experience in this type of development. The team was not prepared for a development project with this degree of rigor, and this is causing significant issues in development and configuration of both the front end and the back end. 

What Went Well?:
Our team began to face our first challenges with scheduling among our members. As is very common in the real world, our different schedules made it difficult for us to find time in which everyone was free for collaboration. Fortunately, our team showed great resilience and determination in both finding times to work together as well as the flexibility to do work in smaller groups or individually.

Overall: 
Given the difficulty of this project, the team and myself are proud of each other's hard work and refusal to quit despite the adversity we faced. While we don't have a perfectly polished product, I'm sure everyone is happy with the progress we made.
