Daily Scrums – Second Sprint
March 26th Scrum Meeting
What did you do in the last 24 hours to help the team reach the Sprint Goal?
• Kylie: Got Firestore set up to store user profiles and made sure authentication tokens persist after login. It took a bit longer than I thought, but everything is falling into place now.
• Jeffrey: Designed the initial Profile UI in Figma and started building it in Flutter. I kept tweaking it because I wanted it to look really clean, but I think it’s solid now.
• Moises: Spent some time figuring out the best way to update user profiles in Firestore and paired with Kylie to make sure we’re doing it right.
• Will: Made sure our Kanban board is updated with detailed sprint tasks. Also cleaned up some of our documentation so we can keep everything organized.
• Deo: Started drafting test cases for profile creation, ran a few UI tests, and helped a bit with the Profile UI to make sure it looked good.

What will you do in the next 24 hours to keep things moving?
• Kylie: Finish connecting Firestore so profile data updates in real time.
• Jeffrey: Work on adding validation for profile fields and get the image upload feature working.
• Moises: Start integrating Firebase storage for profile pictures and make sure updates reflect instantly.
• Will: Keep track of our progress and start putting together the Sprint Review template.
• Deo: Write more test cases and check that profile validation errors are handled properly.

Any roadblocks or issues slowing you down?
• Kylie: Setting up Firestore security rules is a bit trickier than I expected, but I’m close to figuring it out.
• Jeffrey: The profile UI is taking a little longer than planned, but I don’t want to rush it and end up with a mess.
• Moises: Still troubleshooting Firebase storage for images—it’s a little stubborn, but I’ll get it.
• Will: Nothing major, just making sure everything stays on track.
• Deo: Need to confirm what fields we absolutely need for the profile before writing more test cases.

What did you do in the last 24 hours to help the team reach the Sprint Goal?
• Kylie: Got Firestore fully integrated with the profile system and made updates happen in real time. It’s running smoothly now!
• Jeffrey: Wrapped up the profile UI and made sure users can upload profile pictures. The image part was a little annoying, but it’s working now.
• Moises: Helped Jeffrey connect profile updates with Firebase storage and made sure image uploads don’t break things.
• Will: Organized our completed tasks and started getting feedback for our Sprint Review.
• Deo: Wrote automated tests for profile creation and validation, plus did some small UI tweaks to improve consistency.

What will you do in the next 24 hours to keep things moving?
• Kylie: Optimize Firestore queries so profiles load faster.
• Jeffrey: Start designing the swiping UI and make sure the animations feel smooth.
• Moises: Work with Jeffrey on connecting swipe gestures with matchmaking logic.
• Will: Keep refining our documentation and make sure we’re covering everything.
• Deo: Start writing tests for swiping, making sure interactions feel natural and responsive.

Any roadblocks or issues slowing you down?
• Kylie: Query performance could be better, so I’m tweaking a few things.
• Jeffrey: Animations are a little tricky to get just right, but I’m almost there.
• Moises: Found some bugs with image storage—Kylie and I will dig into it together.
• Will: No blockers, just making sure we don’t miss anything before the Sprint Review.
• Deo: Swiping is harder to test because it’s all about gestures, so I’m researching better ways to automate that.

What did you do in the last 24 hours to help the team reach the Sprint Goal?

• Will: Wrapped up our Sprint Review document and made sure everything’s ready for the team.

What will you do in the next 24 hours to keep things moving?
