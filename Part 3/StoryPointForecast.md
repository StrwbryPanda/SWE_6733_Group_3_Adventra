# Story Point Forecast

**Second Sprint**: 3/24/25 - 4/13/25  
**Projected Points:** 30

This team will complete 30 points worth of work during Sprint 2. The relative pointing of each task is based on the team's perceived difficulty and time necessary for each task. The team has little experience with app development, database integration, and advanced UI development, so the point weightings acknowledge the learning curve required. The forecast is also accounting for varying availability of team members across the duration of the sprint, as it is known that members will be away during certain times and that they have other obligations.
